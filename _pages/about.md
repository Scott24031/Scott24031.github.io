Greetings and welcome to my homepage. I am currently pursuing an undergrad degree in Mathematics with a special interest in Algebra and Algebraic Number Theory, which is an area that I am still in the process of mastering. I have taken the liberty of uploading my personal reading notes as well as a collection of blogs on this platform, although I must humbly submit that my professional knowledge and writing may not be at a professional level. I would be honored if you would share any feedback or advice that you may have, as it would greatly assist in my growth and development.

Interested
======
The areas of interested encompass Algebraic Number Theory, Representation Theory, Mathematical Physics and Arithmetic Geometry, as well as the application of mathematics in Theoretical Computer Science.

Some Notes (Upadating)
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
