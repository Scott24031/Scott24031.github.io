Greetings and welcome to my homepage. I am currently pursuing an undergrad degree in Mathematics with a special interest in Algebra and Algebraic Number Theory, which is an area that I am still in the process of mastering. I have taken the liberty of uploading my personal reading notes as well as a collection of blogs on this platform, although I must humbly submit that my professional knowledge and writing may not be at a professional level. I would be honored if you would share any feedback or advice that you may have, as it would greatly assist in my growth and development.

Interested
======
The areas of interested encompass Algebraic Number Theory, Representation Theory, Mathematical Physics and Arithmetic Geometry, as well as the application of mathematics in Theoretical Computer Science.

Some Notes (Upadating)
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Some Remarks
------
Just wanted to let you know that I'm still learning math, so if you notice any errors or typos in my posts or notes, please don't hesitate to DM me. I'd really appreciate your help in improving my skills! Thanks in advance.

For more info
------
More info about me can be found in my [BILIBILI ACCOUNT](https://space.bilibili.com/118961960?spm_id_from=333.1365.0.0). Some notes will also post on my [WORDPRESS](https://scottmath.top/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
