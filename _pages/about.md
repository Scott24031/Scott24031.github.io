Greetings and welcome to my homepage. I am currently pursuing an undergrad degree in Mathematics with a special interest in Algebra and Algebraic Number Theory, which is an area that I am still in the process of mastering. I have taken the liberty of uploading my personal reading notes as well as a collection of blogs on this platform, although I must humbly submit that my professional knowledge and writing may not be at a professional level. I would be honored if you would share any feedback or advice that you may have, as it would greatly assist in my growth and development.

Interested
======
The areas of interested encompass Algebraic Number Theory, Representation Theory, Mathematical Physics and Arithmetic Geometry, as well as the application of mathematics in Theoretical Computer Science.

Some Notes (Upadating)
======
1. For mathematical lecture notes, you can read on [Lecture Notes](https://scott24031.github.io/notes/lecture-notes).
2. For mini-course or summer course notes, you can read on [Mini-course Notes](https://scott24031.github.io/notes/mini-course-notes). 
3. For some physics/mathematical physics notes, you can read on [Lecture notes on Physics](https://scott24031.github.io/notes/physics-notes).

Some Remarks
------
Just wanted to let you know that I'm still learning math, so if you notice any errors or typos in my posts or notes, please don't hesitate to DM me. I'd really appreciate your help in improving my skills! Thanks in advance.

For more info
