These are lecture notes for the course I already studied or still studying, Some of them are the courses from many universities, you can download the notes PDF here:

> Caveat. These notes are not endorsed by the lecturers, and I have modified them (often significantly) after lectures. They are nowhere near accurate representations of what was actually lectured, and in particular, all errors are almost surely mine.
